## Usage  

1. Open the web application in your browser.  
2. Set your KPI questions and create a new project.  
3. Wait for the system to process and generate the benchmarking sheet.  
4. Download your report directly from the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements  

- Addition of sector-specific KPI libraries.  
- Enhanced data visualization within reports.  
- Support for comparing different projects from the same sector together.
- Enhance how batches are handled. If any batch fails for some reason, the model should send another batch request without discarding the other completed results.
